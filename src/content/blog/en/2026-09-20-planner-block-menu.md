summary: "Tapping a block used to open an edit sheet. Now a checkbox completes it and a second tap opens a menu in place. Getting there meant three rounds with UIButton menus that hijack drags."

The day planner we are building places pre-registered todos as blocks on a vertical timeline. Tapping the circle at the left of a block now completes it, and tapping a selected block once more opens a menu right under the finger. Before, a tap opened the edit sheet, which is the wrong weight for an app whose whole point is fixing the day quickly.

## One-tap jobs were opening a sheet

Three things happen to a block all the time: done, move to tomorrow, take it off the schedule. Each is a single action, yet each meant opening the sheet or reaching the floating buttons at the bottom-right corner. Completing took two taps, and the corner is the farthest point from the block.

Todo apps mostly agree on the answer: a context menu where the block is. The new grammar:

| Gesture | Result |
|---|---|
| Tap the checkbox at the left | Toggle done, regardless of selection |
| Tap an unselected block | Select it |
| Tap the selected block again | Context menu: edit, push back from here, pull forward, swap, tomorrow, drawer, remove from schedule |
| Hold 0.2 s then drag, or drag a selected block | Move, unchanged |

The three floating circles at the bottom-right (done, delete, more) are gone. The reschedule tools that lived under "more" moved into the menu, and the edit sheet became one of its items.

## Why a tap menu instead of a long-press menu

The iOS default is long-press. On this timeline, a 0.2-second long press already starts a drag, and `UIContextMenuInteraction` steals that press, so the rule was never to attach one. The tap was the slot left over, and a selected block has already been tapped once, so a second tap reads naturally as "what can I do with this".

An action sheet is easy to present programmatically but slides up from the bottom, which is not "right here". `UIEditMenuInteraction` can be presented at a point but renders as the horizontal copy/paste bar and pages eight items. That left a `UIButton` with `showsMenuAsPrimaryAction`.

## UIButton menus fooled me three times

First, an invisible button that took no touches, presented with `performPrimaryAction()`. The menu appears, but always at the top-left of the screen. It ignores the anchor entirely, whatever frame the button has.

Second, let the button take the tap. Now the menu appears under the finger. But holding for about 0.2 seconds opens it too: pull-down menus open on hold. A resize that started by holding the handle briefly turned into a menu, and dragging on from there executes whatever item is under the finger when it lifts. The last item was "remove from schedule". The smoke test passed anyway, because it held, dragged, and never checked that the block had moved.

Third, try to disable only the hold-to-open recognizer among the five the button installs (tap, touch-down, press, two relationship recognizers). Keep only the tap and the menu stops appearing; drop only the press and the hold stays. The hold timer belongs to the touch-down recognizer the tap presentation needs. Hiding the button when a drag starts is too late.

Instrumenting the recognizers showed what was going on: our long press returned true from `shouldBegin` and never reached `began`. The button's relationship recognizer was suppressing it at the same 0.2-second mark.

The fix inverts the relationship. Every recognizer the button installs is made to require our long press to fail:

```swift
for recognizer in menuButton.gestureRecognizers ?? [] {
    recognizer.require(toFail: layerLongPress)
}
```

A short tap lets the long press fail, then the button's tap fires and the menu opens under the finger. Holding past 0.2 seconds starts the drag and every button recognizer fails. The selected block now starts the same drag from a long press as an unselected one (body moves, handles resize), so the grammar is the same everywhere.

The smoke test now asserts "hold 0.5 s, drag, block moved 160 pt, no menu". A gesture test that performs the gesture without measuring its result will wave this class of regression through.

## What is left

VoiceOver can activate the block title to select it and reach the menu, but it cannot hit the checkbox band. The title carries a done/not-done value for now; a proper accessibility action for completion is next.
